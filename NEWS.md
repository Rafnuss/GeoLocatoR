# GeoLocatoR 1.1.0

- Added support for frictionless 1.3.0 and migrated to its `resource_names()`
  API. GeoLocator-DP profile-version warnings are suppressed while the package
  remains on Data Package v1. Compatibility with frictionless 2.0.0 will be
  addressed separately.
- Simplified internal resource updates by using frictionless's add-or-replace
  behaviour.

- Improved `read_gldp()` diagnostics for unreadable resources and added support
  for passing a package directory.
- Improved Darwin Core export by using most-likely paths for exported locations,
  rounding elevations, and completing occurrence and event fields.
- `read_soi()` now fails early when duplicate `GDL_ID` values are encountered.
- Resolved package-check notes and tidyselect deprecation warnings.
