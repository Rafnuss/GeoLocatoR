\title{Merge Two GeoLocator Data Packages}
\usage{
merge_gldp(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A GeoLocator Data Package object.}

\item{y}{A GeoLocator Data Package object.}
}
\value{
A single GeoLocator Data Package object containing the merged data from both \code{x} and \code{y}.
}
\description{
Merges two GeoLocator Data Package objects (\code{x} and \code{y}) into a single combined package.
The metadata properties from both packages are merged according to specific rules,
and resource data is combined based on their presence in either package.
}
\details{
\strong{Metadata merging rules:}
\itemize{
\item \strong{title}: Combined from both packages, separated by a "/".
\item \strong{contributors}: Combined from both packages, with duplicates removed.
\item \strong{embargo}: Set to the latest date from both packages.
\item \strong{licenses}: Combined from both packages, with duplicates removed.
\item \strong{id}: Removed from the merged package.
\item \strong{description}: Combined as two separate paragraphs, with a newline separator.
\item \strong{version}: Removed from the merged package.
\item \strong{relatedIdentifiers}: Combined, with duplicates removed.
\item \strong{grants}: Combined from both packages, with duplicates removed.
\item \strong{keywords}: Combined from both packages, with duplicates removed.
\item \strong{created}: Set to the current timestamp at the time of merging.
\item \strong{bibliographicCitation}: Removed from the merged package.
\item Custom properties from \code{x} are retained in the merged package.
}

\strong{Resource merging logic:}
\itemize{
\item Each resource is checked for its presence in both \code{x} and \code{y}.
\item Data from both sources is combined if the resource exists in either \code{x} or \code{y}.
\item Resources are only included if they exist in at least one of the packages.
}
