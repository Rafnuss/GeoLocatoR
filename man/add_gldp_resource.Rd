\description{
This function adds a resource to a geolocator data package and ensures that the data conforms to
the schema defined for that resource. It is a wrapper of \href{https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/reference/add_resource.html}{\code{frictionless::add_resource} } where it first validate
against the schema and potentially modify the data frame \code{data} before adding it to the package.

More specifically, the function adjusts the data frame according to the schema's
\href{https://datapackage.org/standard/table-schema/#fieldsMatch}{\code{fieldsMatch}} property and also
cast the type/class of the columns provided according to. \code{cast_type}.

Note that this function is generally not recommended to be used as all resources can be added or
modified with their respective \href{https://bit.ly/41HruRs}{accessors functions}.
