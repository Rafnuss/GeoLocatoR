**GeoLocatoR** is an R package that helps you create, use, and share your geolocator data in an easy way.

## üöÄ Overview

GeoLocatoR is designed to help you create and work with the [GeoLocator Data Package (GeoLocator DP)](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoLocator-DP/), a standardized format for geolocator data that follows the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/), ensuring your data is organized, accessible, and ready to share.

## ü¶Ö Main Features

- **Creates a GeoLocator Data Package**: Create a geolocator datapackage object, add resources (data), and write the data package to your preferred directory. Or, read an existing data package from a directory or from Zenodo.
- **Works Seamlessly with GeoPressureTemplate**: GeoLocatoR is compatible with [GeoPressureTemplate](https://github.com/Rafnuss/GeoPressureTemplate) ‚Äî a template repository for analyzing geolocator data using GeoPressureR. Use both together to streamline your analysis and maintain a standardized project structure. 
- **Supports Swiss Ornithological Institute Data**: Special functions have been designed to deal with internal SOI data. [See this vignette](https://rpubs.com/rafnuss/geolocator_create_from_soi). 
- **Built on frictionless-r**: This package is built using the [`frictionless-r`](https://docs.ropensci.org/frictionless/) package, adhering to the Frictionless Data standards for open data. 

## üì¶ What is a Data Package?

A **Data Package** is a lightweight format for packaging data using the [Data Package standard](https://datapackage.org/standard/data-package/). It provides a framework for organizing your data files, metadata, and descriptive information in a consistent and reusable manner. For geolocator data, this ensures that information about tagged birds, their movements, and associated metadata are all bundled into a single exchangeable package. Learn more about the GeoLocator DP standard [here](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoLocator-DP/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install GeoLocatoR from GitHub:

```r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("Rafnuss/GeoLocatoR")
````

## üìñ Usage

Learn how to use GeoLocatoR with the dedicated part of the [GeoPressureManual](https://raphaelnussbaumer.com/GeoPressureManual/geolocator-intro.html).
